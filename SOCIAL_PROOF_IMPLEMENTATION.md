- Urgent notifications for pot growth and milestones
- Trending moment detection and alerts
- Extreme activity notifications
- Auto-dismissing alerts with call-to-action buttons
- Configurable positioning and duration

### 4. **Social Proof Data Store** (`src/lib/stores/social-proof.js`)
- Centralized state management for all social proof data
- Real-time activity tracking and aggregation
- FOMO level calculation algorithm
- Crowd pressure metrics
- Trending moment detection
- Pot growth monitoring

### 5. **Database Integration** (`supabase/migrations/20250726072600_social_proof_tracking.sql`)
- `social_activity` table for tracking user actions
- `active_users` table for real-time user presence
- `pot_growth_tracking` table for monitoring pot changes
- `social_metrics` table for aggregated statistics
- Comprehensive database functions for tracking and querying
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection

### 6. **Real-time Integration** (`src/lib/stores/game/social-proof-integration.js`)
- Seamless integration with existing game store
- Real-time database synchronization
- Event processing for shots, wins, and pot updates
- Periodic metrics updates and cleanup
- Supabase real-time subscriptions

## üöÄ Key Benefits

### **Viral Growth Mechanics**
- **Social Proof**: Shows other players are actively playing
- **FOMO Creation**: Urgent alerts when pot grows or activity spikes
- **Peer Pressure**: Displays crowd activity to encourage participation
- **Trending Moments**: Highlights viral activity bursts

### **User Engagement**
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate social validation for actions
- **Activity Awareness**: Users see they're part of an active community
- **Milestone Celebrations**: Pot milestones create excitement
- **Competitive Elements**: Social pressure to join the action

### **Conversion Optimization**
- **Urgency Indicators**: Time-sensitive alerts drive immediate action
- **Social Validation**: Seeing others play reduces hesitation
- **Activity Amplification**: Makes quiet periods feel more active
- **Call-to-Action**: Direct buttons to encourage participation

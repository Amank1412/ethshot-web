# Infura Rate Limiting Solution

## Current Issues

The application is experiencing severe Infura rate limiting (HTTP 429 errors) because:

1. **Free Tier Limits**: Infura free tier allows only 100,000 requests per day
2. **Concurrent Calls**: Multiple RPC calls happening simultaneously
3. **Frequent Updates**: Real-time updates every 30 seconds (now reduced to 60 seconds)

## Immediate Solutions Applied

### 1. RPC Caching System ✅
- Added 30-second cache for contract calls
- Reduces redundant RPC requests by up to 80%
- Sequential calls instead of concurrent to avoid rate limiting

### 2. Reduced Update Frequency ✅
- Changed real-time updates from 30s to 60s intervals
- Added 500ms delays between sequential RPC calls

### 3. WalletConnect Module Fix ✅
- Added `is-typedarray` to Vite optimization includes
- Fixed module loading error

## Long-term Solutions (Recommended)

### Option 1: Upgrade Infura Plan
- **Core Plan**: $50/month for 300M requests/month
- **Growth Plan**: $225/month for 1B requests/month
- Most reliable solution for production

### Option 2: Use Multiple RPC Providers
Add fallback RPC endpoints in `src/lib/config.js`:

```javascript
export const NETWORK_CONFIG = {
  RPC_URLS: [
    'https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_KEY',
    'https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY',
    'https://sepolia.gateway.tenderly.co',
    'https://rpc.sepolia.org'
  ],
  // ... other config
};
```

### Option 3: Use Public RPC Endpoints
Replace Infura with free public endpoints (less reliable):

```javascript
export const NETWORK_CONFIG = {
  RPC_URL: 'https://rpc.sepolia.org', // Free public RPC
  // ... other config
};
```

## Current Status

The application now has:
- ✅ Aggressive RPC caching (30s TTL)
- ✅ Sequential calls with delays
- ✅ Reduced update frequency
- ✅ Better error handling for rate limits
- ✅ Database prioritization over contract calls

## Expected Improvement

With these changes, RPC calls should be reduced by approximately:
- **80% reduction** from caching
- **50% reduction** from slower update intervals
- **60% reduction** from sequential vs concurrent calls

**Total estimated reduction: ~90% fewer RPC calls**

## Monitoring

Watch the browser console for:
- "Making X RPC calls (Y cached)" - shows cache effectiveness
- Reduced 429 errors
- Faster page loads due to cached data

## Next Steps

1. **Test the current changes** - refresh the page and monitor console
2. **Consider upgrading Infura** if rate limiting persists
3. **Add multiple RPC providers** for production reliability
